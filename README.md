# Azure-move-supported-resources
This repository contains a CSV extract of Microsoft's 'Move operation support for resources' page (https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/move-support-resources).  I'll be updating the list whenever this page changes.

It also has the PowerShell script I used to create it for reference.

# References
Partially inspired by @tfitzmac's [resource capabilities](https://github.com/tfitzmac/resource-capabilities) repository, in that the default behaviours of the script are to use 0 and 1 and to not include region moves, but otherwise created from scratch.
